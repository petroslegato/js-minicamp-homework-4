# Homework #4

## Instructions
---
1. Feynman Writing Prompts - Write out explanations of the following concepts like you are explaining it to a 12 year old.  Doing this will help you quickly discover any holes in your understanding.  Ask your questions on Slack.
		
	* Callback Functions — it's a function that takes the name of another function as its input parameter/argument, which is then invoked inside the outer function to complete some kind of routine or action. 
	* Closure — levels of 'reference preservation' with regard to scope issues — particularly when accessing an outer functions scope from within an inner function. See also: lexical scoping.
	* `arguments` — arguments is an object that is accessible inside functions that contain the values of the arguments passed to that function.
	* Recursion — a function calling itself, used to solve problems that contain smaller sub-problems. A recursive function can receive two inputs: a base case (ends recursion) or a recursive case (resumes recursion).
	* `prototype` — Prototypes are the mechanism by which JavaScript objects inherit features from one another
	* Constructors — The constructor method is a special method of a class for creating and initializing an object instance of that class.


2. Fork and clone this repo.  When you need to commit use the following commands.
		
	* `git status`
	* `git add --all`
	* `git status`
	* `git commit -m "your commit message"`
	* `git push origin master`

3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.  Run tests using `npm test`.

4. Make the tests pass!
